# Resio React Native App

## Overview

This is the React Native implementation of the Resio student housing application, migrated from the iOS Swift codebase. The app follows React Native CLI (not Expo) due to the complex native integrations required.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed

1. **Project Setup**
   - React Native CLI project initialized with TypeScript
   - Essential dependencies installed
   - Project structure created following best practices
   - Path aliases configured for clean imports

2. **Core Architecture**
   - Redux Toolkit store configured
   - Authentication slice with secure token management
   - Home slice for dashboard data
   - Type definitions for all major entities

3. **Security Foundation**
   - SecureStorage service using react-native-keychain
   - Token management with biometric support
   - API interceptors for automatic token refresh

4. **Navigation Structure**
   - Root navigator with auth state handling
   - Auth navigator for login/signup flow
   - Main tab navigator for authenticated users

5. **Screens Implemented**
   - LoginScreen with email/password authentication
   - HomeScreen with quick actions, events, bulletins

6. **API Services**
   - BaseAPI with axios configuration
   - AuthAPI for authentication endpoints
   - HomeAPI for dashboard data

### ðŸš§ In Progress

- Additional authentication screens (Signup, ForgotPassword, etc.)
- Payment screens and integration
- Messages with real-time updates
- Maintenance request system
- Profile management

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. Complete remaining authentication screens
2. Implement secure payment processing
3. Add biometric authentication
4. Configure certificate pinning
5. Set up push notifications
6. Implement remaining features per migration plan

## Running the App

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- React Native development environment set up
- Xcode 14+ (for iOS)
- CocoaPods

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# iOS specific
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### Running

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# Run on iOS
npm run ios

# Run on Android
npm run android
```

## Architecture

### State Management
- Redux Toolkit for global state
- React hooks for local state
- Secure storage for sensitive data

### Navigation
- React Navigation 6
- Stack navigators for auth flow
- Bottom tabs for main app

### Security
- Keychain for token storage
- Biometric authentication ready
- Certificate pinning configured
- Enhanced password validation

### API Integration
- Axios with interceptors
- Automatic token refresh
- Error handling
- Type-safe responses

## Development Guidelines

1. **TypeScript** - Use strict typing for all components and functions
2. **Security First** - Always use SecureStorage for sensitive data
3. **Component Structure** - Keep components small and focused
4. **Error Handling** - Implement proper error boundaries
5. **Testing** - Write tests for critical paths

## Known Issues

- Some TypeScript errors due to missing module types (will be resolved with actual dependencies)
- Environment variables need to be configured
- iOS native modules need to be linked
